# Project Napster File Transfer
 Project created for the Distributed Systems class at the Federal University of ABC.

 Create a P2P system that allows the transfer of giant video files (more than 1GB) between peers, intermediated by a centralized server, using TCP as the communication.
 The system will work in a similar way (but very reduced) to the Napster system, one of the First P2P systems, created by Shawn Fanning at the age of 18.
